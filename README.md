HTML and CSS drawing

Remixed from https://github.com/richardpwechsler/web-drawing

In this project I decided to build upon the idea of the original creator and give the webpage a new feel. With 3d Transforms and css animations, I attempted to give the original design a tv screen to be on. I also replaced the original music with lofi and attempted to time the animations with the bpm of the music. I also threw in a low-opacity gif of the windows pipes screensaver to give it more personality but to not take away from the focus of the main aspect of the artwork. This gives the page a different feel altogether. To me, the development of this project was the culmination of all the techniques we covered in class for the first half of the semester and the end result was very rewarding.
